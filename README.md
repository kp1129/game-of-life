# game-of-life

[VIEW LIVE DEMO](https://game-of-life-rosy.vercel.app/)

This project is my implementation of a computer science classic, John Conway's "Game of Life."   
The program simulates cellular automaton and allows the user to observe how their initial   
cellular/population configuration will evolve over time based on the rules of the game.  

The app was built using React, & bootstrapped with create-react-app.
